# StockValuationCalculator
An application made using Java and HTML/CSS. It uses the discounted cash flow model to output the intrinsic value of a company and whether the company is trading at an undervalued or overvalued price. It will also output the margin of safety that you would have if you invested in the company. The user will have to input certain information from the cash flow statement of the company and their personal choice of how much opportunity cost they would like to discount.

In order to get the correct output the user must enter information 
from the cash flow statement of the company which they're trying to
find the value of.
